# Simple-Linear-Regression-by-The-AI
In this repository I attach my work done with one of the Machine Learning Algorithms called Linear Regression. I try to make it as simple as I can. I include Applied Linear Regression as well as the background process used by scikit-learn Linear Regression model.
You can find Applied Simple Linear Regression in Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb notebook.
If you want to see the process of how Simple Linear Regression works?? then you may visit Simple_Linear_Regression_Logic.ipynb notebook.
I also include sufficient theory within the notebook.
